robot code for FIRST STEAMWORKS 2017

This year our team simultaneously explored using both Java and Labview for our robot. 
Ultimately we decided to go with labview as the sum of our experience was greater with that than java.

The Labview code we developed and used can be found [here](https://github.com/roboticsdude60/DeputyDawg).

This repository is the java code for our robot which I initially started, but did not continue developement in. 
It was not used in any competitions but was tested in our shop. 

For more about the game/challenge we designed our robot for, see [FIRST Steamworks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Steamworks) on wikipedia, or watch [this animated game reveal](
